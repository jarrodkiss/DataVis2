  <h1>Arrivals and Departures into Australia by Country of Citizenship</h1>
  <p>This dashboard is designed to outline the countries that have contributed to Australian tourism and migration since 1991 and has been created by Jarrod Kiss as student of Monash University Australia.</p>

  <div class="graph-section">
    <h2>Arrivals into Australia by Citizenship</h2>
    <div class="graph-content" id="Vis1_Arrivals_Map"></div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>This map shows the number of arrivals into Australia by country of citizenship. You can use the sliders below to select the month and the year for which the map will display the data for. You will notice that during the periods between 2020 and 2022 all arrivals substantially drop, this is due to the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdown and travel restrictions. Overall, the trend for arrivals is upward, note that some countries do decrease due to internal political and economic factors. It is also important to note that, as the data goes back to January of 1991, some countries will have a value of '1' as there is no data as there country may not yet exist, for example modern day Russia was not founded until December 1991.</p>

      <p>This map shows the number of departures from Australia by country of citizenship. You can use the sliders below to select the month and the year for which the map will display the data for. You will notice that during the periods between 2020 and 2022 all departures substantially drop, this is due to the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdown and travel restrictions. Overall, we can see that departures closely mimic arrivals overtime, if not trailing by a month or two likely due to tourists leaving shortly after entering. The primary difference can likely be attributed primarily to permanent immigration into Australia.</p>

    <div class="graph-content" id="arrivals_departures_linechart"></div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>This line chart seeks to show the overall annual trend of both arrivals and departures from Australia since 1991. We can see that there has been a substantial climb in both arrivals and departures from roughly 4.5 million for both in 1991 to now approximately 13 million annually for both arrivals and departures. We can also see a sharp drop in both arrivals and departures during the coronavirus pandemic (2020-2022) due to travel restrictions. We can also see that levels have yet to reach their pre-pandemic highs.</p>
