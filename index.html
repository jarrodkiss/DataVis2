  <h1>Arrivals and Departures into Australia by Country of Citizenship</h1>
  <p>This dashboard, created by Jarrod Kiss, a student at Monash University Australia, outlines the countries that have contributed to Australian tourism and migration since 1991.

    <h2>Arrivals into Australia by Citizenship</h2>
    <div class="graph-content" id="Vis1_Arrivals_Map"></div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>This map visualizes the number of arrivals into Australia by country of citizenship. You can use the sliders below to select the specific month and year for which the data is displayed. You will notice that during the periods between 2020 and 2022, all arrivals substantially dropped due to the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdowns and travel restrictions. Overall, the trend for arrivals is upward, though some countries experience decreases due to internal political and economic factors. It is also important to note that, as the data goes back to January 1991, some countries will show a value of '1' as their country may not have existed at that time (e.g., modern-day Russia was founded in December 1991).</p>

    <h2>Departures from Australia by Country of Citizenship</h2>
    <div class="graph-content" id="Vis2_Departures_Map"></div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>This map shows the number of departures from Australia by country of citizenship. You can use the sliders below to select the month and year for which the map will display the data. During the period from 2020 to 2022, all departures substantially dropped due to the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdowns and travel restrictions. Departures closely mimic arrivals over time, often trailing by a month or two, likely due to tourists leaving shortly after arriving. The primary difference can likely be attributed to permanent immigration into Australia.</p>

    <h2>Total Arrivals and Departures from Australia over Time</h2>
    <div class="graph-content" id="arrivals_departures_linechart"></div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>This line chart seeks to show the overall annual trend of both arrivals and departures from Australia since 1991. We can see a substantial increase in both arrivals and departures, from approximately 4.5 million in 1991 to around 13 million annually. Both arrivals and departures experienced a sharp drop during the coronavirus pandemic (2020-2022) due to travel restrictions, and have not yet returned to their pre-pandemic highs.</p>

    <h2>Arrivals into Australia by the Top 5 Contributing Countries in 2023 (Excludes Australian Citizens)</h2>
    <div class="graph-content" id="top5arrivals10yrs"></div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>This line graph shows the 5 countries that have most contributed to people inflows into Australia. Over the last 10 years, we can observe an upward trend, with a drop during the coronavirus pandemic. There is evidence that inflows from New Zealand recovered much faster than those from other countries. This is likely due to the Trans-Tasman bubble that opened in mid-2021, allowing travel between Australia and New Zealand before other countries' citizens could enter. Additionally, inflows from these countries tend to be seasonal, occurring largely during the summer months, particularly in December. However, inflows from China peak in February, likely due to the arrival of international students coming to study in Australia.</p>
