  <h1>Arrivals and Departures into Australia by Country of Citizenship</h1>
  <p>This dashboard is designed to outline the countries that have contributed to Australian tourism and migration since 1991.</p>

      <h2>Arrivals into Australia by Citizenship</h2>
      <p>This map shows the number of arrivals into Australia by country of citizenship. You can use the sliders below to select the month and the year for which the map will display the data for. You will notice that during the periods between 2020 and 2022 all arrivals substantially drop, this is due to the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdown and travel restrictions. Overall, the trend for arrivals is upward, note that some countries do decrease due to internal political and economic factors. It is also important to note that, as the data goes back to January of 1991, some countries will have a value of '1' as there is no data as there country may not yet exist, for example modern day Russia was not founded until December 1991.</p>

      <h2>Departures from Australia by Country of Citizenship</h2>
      <p>This map shows the number of departures from Australia by country of citizenship. You can use the sliders below to select the month and the year for which the map will display the data for. You will notice that during the periods between 2020 and 2022 all departures substantially drop, this is due to the coronavirus pandemic and associated lockdown and travel restrictions. Overall, we can see that departures closely mimic arrivals overtime, if not trailing by a month or two likely due to tourists leaving shortly after entering. The primary difference can likely be attributed primarily to permanent immigration into Australia. </p>

      <h2>Total Arrivals and Departures from Australia over Time</h2>
      <p>This line chart seeks to show the overall annual trend of both arrivals and departures from Australia since 1991. We can see that there has been a substantial climb in both arrivals and departures from roughly 4.5 million for both in 1991 to now approximately 13 million annually for both arrivals and departures. We can also see a sharp drop in both arrivals and departures during the coronavirus pandemic (2020-2022) due to travel restrictions. We can also see that levels have yet to reach their pre-pandemic highs.</p>

      <h2>Arrivals into Australia by the Top 5 Contributing Countries in 2023 (Excludes Australia)</h2>
      <p>This line graph shows the 5 countries that have most contributed to people inflows into Australia. We can see similarly to all other countries, there has been an upward trend over the last 10 years, with a drop during the coronavirus pandemic. There is also evidence that inflows from New Zealand recovered far faster than the rest of the world. This is likely due to the trans-Tasman bubble that opened in mid 2021 that allowed travel between Australia and New Zealand before other countries citizens could travel to Australia. Additionally, inflows from these countries appears to be very seasonal, occuring largely in the summer months such as December. China however, peaks in February, this is likely due to mass inflows of international students coming to study in Australia. </p>
